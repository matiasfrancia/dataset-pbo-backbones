# Backbone Extraction Dataset (SAT 2025)

This repository contains the dataset `complete_backbones.tar.gz`, which includes backbone extraction results from three extractors on 8,351 Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) instances. The data was produced as part of the experiments described in a research paper submitted to the SAT 2025 Conference.

The instances used in this dataset are taken from the **OPT-LIN track** of the benchmark proposed for the **Pseudo-Boolean Competition 2024**.

## File Contents

- **`complete_backbones.csv`**: A CSV file with one row per backbone extraction attempt, including both metadata and backbone information for each instance.

## Backbone Extractors Used

- [NapBack](https://github.com/BryanAlvarado777/napback): backbone extractor based in the integration of the solver NaPS and the backbone extractor CadiBack.
- [GuroBack](https://github.com/BryanAlvarado777/guroback): backbone extractor built upon the commercial solver Gurobi.
- [RoundingBack](https://github.com/matiasfrancia/roundingback.git): backbone extractor based in the native PBO solver RoundingSat.

## File Format and Structure

Each row corresponds to a single instance, and includes the following fields:

| Column Name                  | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Instance`                  | Path to the PBO instance following the directory structure proposed in the [PBO Competition 2024](https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/PB24/) |
| `Extractor`                 | Backbone extractor used (`GuroBack`, `NapBack`, or `RoundingBack`)                            |
| `Extraction Time`           | Time in seconds required to extract the backbone                                              |
| `Number of Variables`       | Total number of variables in the instance                                                     |
| `Objective`                 | Optimal objective value of the instance                                                       |
| `Optimization Solving Time` | Time in seconds taken to solve the optimization problem and obtain the optimum                |
| `Backbone Size`             | Number of literals that belong to the backbone                                                |
| `x_1`, ..., `x_k`           | Backbone status of each variable (see section below)                                          |

### Backbone Variables (`x_i`)

For each instance, the backbone columns follow the format `x_1`, `x_2`, ..., up to `x_n`, where `n` is the number of variables **in that instance only**.

- `'1'`: Variable is in the backbone with **positive polarity**
- `'0'`: Variable is in the backbone with **negative polarity**
- `'2'`: Variable is **not** in the backbone

ðŸ”¹ **Important**: The CSV includes headers up to `x_1281998`, corresponding to the maximum number of variables observed across all instances. However, each row contains values **only up to the number of variables in the respective instance**. Thus, rows are effectively "ragged" in length. The header line is provided for reference.
